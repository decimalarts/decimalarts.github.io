        <p><b>Decimal Arts</b> is an independent game studio based in Melbourne, Australia.
We create narrative-driven games rooted in place, history, and human experience.
We believe that games, like all art forms, shape culture. We build carefully, ask questions deliberately, and design experiences that people can connect with.</p>

    <h2>About Decimal Arts</h2>
    <p><b>We make narrative games with depth, intention, and craft.</b></p>

<p>Our current project is a story-driven game set in a parallel Melbourne in a near-future shaped by the technological optimism of the late ’90s and early 2000s. It’s a thriller, a mystery, and a meditation on technology, capitalism, and connection.
Through environmental storytelling, nuanced dialogue, and layered worldbuilding, we invite players into stories that mirror and question the world around us.</p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <ul class="work-list">
      <li>
        <span class="work-label">Thoughtfully</span>
        We research deeply, listen carefully, and create with intention. From location scouting to sound recording, we like to create grounded experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="work-label">Collaboratively</span>
        Our studio was born from collaboration between disciplines, perspectives, and people. We work with local actors, artists, and developers to build worlds together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="work-label">Precisely</span>
        We bring care and precision to every element: narrative, design, visuals, performance; knowing that small details matter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="work-label">Responsively</span>
        We design for the present but build with the future in mind. Our work reflects the changing landscapes of technology, culture, and storytelling.

    <h2>Why Decimal Arts?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="why-bold">Our name reflects how we think:</span><br>
      Decimals represent the space between. Between <span class="why-bold">0 and 1</span>. Between nothing and something. Between beginnings and completions.<br>
      Our work lives in that space. Exploring ambiguity, connection, and the thresholds of change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="why-bold">In games, in art, in life: there’s beauty in precision, in iteration, and in what comes between.</span>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Decimal Arts is at the start of its journey: small in size, ambitious in vision.</b><br><br>
      Our first project will shape our foundation. Beyond that, we will continue to create work that is considered, human, and culturally resonant.<br><br>
      If you care about meaningful storytelling, crafted worlds, and the future of narrative games, we’d love for you to follow along.
