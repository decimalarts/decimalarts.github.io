<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p><b>Right now, it's just us two: Ema and James.</b> We met almost a decade ago studying game design in Melbourne, finding common ground in shared values: creativity, curiosity, connection, and collaboration.</p>
<p>
  Our first time collaborating happened organically. We set up an art club at university where we created concept art prompts for our teammates and ourselves. We weren’t quite aware of it at the time, but that art club gave us space to have honest fun, challenge ourselves to grow, and to make friends along the way.
</p>
<p>
  At the core of our creative process, our values remain the same. Everything we do starts with a conversation, passionately fuelled by the possibilities of what could be.
</p>
<p>
  <b>We cherish that place.</b> We nurture the start.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, we’ve kept creating together, even in our individual projects, spanning across different media. From James’ photography, documentaries, countless sketchbook drawings, and 3D-art explorations to Ema’s pursuits in music production, fashion design, and branding projects, there has always been a sense of collaboration and mutual support.
</p>
<p>
  Later, we had the opportunity to work together at a game studio, creating games alongside many talented and dedicated individuals — some of whom became close friends. This hands-on experience gave us valuable insight into the game development process and taught us how to thoughtfully scope and realistically plan our own projects with <b>Decimal Arts</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Our journey together evolved into <b>Decimal Arts</b>: a place to build the kinds of stories we’ve always believed in — thoughtful, human, and meaningful.
</p>
<p>
  From our earliest conversations to where we are now, our creative process has always honored the <b>space between:</b> where questions spark stories, and stories shape worlds.
